## 👨‍💻 About Me

I am a **Junior Software Engineer** with hands-on experience across multiple programming languages and backend technologies, including **Java, C++, C#, RESTful APIs, and SQL databases**.

I have completed several **technical internships and structured training programs**, where I built a solid foundation in **backend development**, **software engineering principles**, and **problem-solving**. My experience includes working with **relational databases**, implementing backend business logic, and applying **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** concepts in real projects.

I am currently **open to paid internship or full-time opportunities** in software development or related technical roles, where I can continue learning, growing, and contributing to professional engineering teams.
